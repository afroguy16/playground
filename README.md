# JS Playground
A playground to test some browser APIs and Javascript concept. There is an attempt to use only vanilla js and browser APIs, but you know this isn't possible 😁 so there is a dependency, which is any local server helper e.g. [Lite Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), it's required to load JS module.
