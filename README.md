# Playground
A playground to test some browser APIs and Javascript concepts. This project is written in vanilla JS and supported by some libraries. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used to bundle the code and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is used to transpile to an older JavaScript version. All dependencies used are in `package.json`, so you need to `npm i` before you serve the application. Details on how to start the application is [below](https://github.com/afroguy16/playground#start-up).

### Start up
To start up the application:
1. Navigate to the root folder in your terminal
2. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
2. Once that is done. Run `npm start` to start the application
