# Web Component Playground
A playground to test Web Components concept using TypeScript and some native browser APIs. This is a TypeScript project with no framework required; however, some libraries are required for setup as well as some helper functionality. A full list of dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file. Once this repo has been clone, you need to run `npm i` to install all dependencies. A guide on how to get it up and running can be found in the ["Start up" section](https://github.com/afroguy16/playground#start-up). [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used to bundle the code, support loading, and more, while loaders are used to load and transpile TS, SASS, and so on. Check out `webpack.config.js` for full details.

### Start up
To start up the application:
1. Navigate to the root folder in your terminal
2. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies
2. Once that is done. Run `npm start` to start the application
