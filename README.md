# Playground
A playground to test some browser APIs and Javascript concept. This project is written in vanilla JS, no framework, library or package is required. However you would need to have a local server package installed on your machine in order to load JS modules, which is used in this application. I personally use [Lite Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), but you can use anyone of your choice.

### Start up
To start up the application:
1. Navigate to the root folder in your terminal
2. Start up your local server, for lite-server, here is the command: `npx lite-server`

### Selected Tools used
The list of tools and concept used are inexhaustive, so I am going to only list the ones that are fairly new or that I find interesting.
1. [CSS Script Module](https://web.dev/css-module-scripts/)
